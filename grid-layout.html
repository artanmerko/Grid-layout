      <p> What is grid layout? <br>
       <i> A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating
       a pattern against which we can line up our design elements. They help us
       to create layouts in which our elements won't jump around or change width
       as we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on our websites.
       A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each
        row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.</i>
